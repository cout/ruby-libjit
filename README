Ruby-libjit 0.1.0
Copyright (C) 2008 Paul Brannan

Ruby-libjit is a wrapper for the libjit library.  It provides basic
functionality for jit-compiling functions, including integrating those
functions as callable methods from within Ruby.  Abstractions are also
provided so that jit code may be written in a ruby-like manner.

A simple example:

  :include: sample/simple.rb

Looping structures and other abstractions are provided to make writing
jit code easier:

  :include: sample/fib.rb

For a more complete JIT framework and compiler for Ruby code, please
